# Purpose

[OpenArabic.io](https://openarabic.io) is a platform for learning classical arabic (*al-Fuṣḥā*). The main goal is to aid in the process of starting to read and understand classical Islamic texts using a process based on the [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) algorithm.

## Start developing

## Technologies
