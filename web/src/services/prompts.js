--- Example output:

Great job! Now let's examine the sentence in more detail:

→ إنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ (innama al-a'malu bi an-niyyati) 
this sentence can be understood as "Verily, actions are (judged) by intentions". The restrictive particle إنَّمَا emphasizes that it is only the intentions that determine the value of the actions. The preposition بِ (bi) links the nouns الأَعْمَالُ (al-a'malu, actions) and النِّيَّاتِ (an-niyyati, intentions), showing the relationship between them in the sentence.

Now, let's delve deeper into the words of the sentence:

→ إنَّمَا (innama)
This word is a Particle (harf) and is not derived from a three-letter root word. It functions as a restrictive particle, emphasizing that only the following statement is true or correct.

→ الأَعْمَالُ (al-a'malu)
This word is a Noun (ism), Plural (jama'), and Definite (ma'arifa). It is derived from the three-letter root word ع-م-ل ('-m-l). The root word means "to work" or "to do". Here, الأَعْمَالُ refers to "actions" or "deeds".

→ بِ (bi)
This word is a Particle (harf) and is not derived from a three-letter root word. It functions as a preposition that means "with" or "by".

→ النِّيَّاتِ (an-niyyati)
This word is a Noun (ism), Plural (jama'), and Definite (ma'arifa). It is derived from the three-letter root word ن-و-ي (n-w-y). The root word means "to intend" or "to have a purpose". Here, النِّيَّاتِ refers to "intentions".
